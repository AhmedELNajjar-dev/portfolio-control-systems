      title: 'Analog PID Controller for Light Intensity Control',
      shortDescription: 'An analog PID controller implemented using operational amplifiers to regulate light intensity of a DC lamp with manual tuning of proportional, integral, and derivative gains.',
      fullDescription: 'This project presents the design and implementation of an analog PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for light intensity control using operational amplifiers. The system regulates the light intensity of a DC-powered lamp to a desired reference level despite disturbances and parameter variations. The controller consists of three main stages: Proportional (P) stage using an inverting amplifier with adjustable gain Kp, Integral (I) stage using an op-amp integrator with capacitor feedback, and Derivative (D) stage using an op-amp differentiator. The outputs of these stages are summed using a summing amplifier to produce the final control signal, which drives the lamp through a power driver circuit. The system uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor in a voltage divider configuration to provide feedback. The controller was implemented on a custom PCB following proper analog layout practices to improve reliability and reduce noise. Individual testing of P, I, and D stages confirmed their theoretical effects on system performance, with successful integration of ID (Integral-Derivative) combination demonstrating proper control behavior.',

      fullDescription: 'This project presents an automated solar tracking system using an AVR microcontroller (ATmega328P) that dynamically adjusts a solar panel\'s position for optimal sunlight exposure throughout the day. The system utilizes two Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) positioned on the east and west sides to detect light intensity differences. Based on the light imbalance, a servo motor (SG90) adjusts its angle to align the panel toward the brighter direction, maximizing energy collection efficiency. The implementation includes PWM-based servo control, analog-to-digital conversion for LDR inputs, and an LCD interface via I2C to display real-time data such as LDR readings, error values, and servo position. A UART interface allows manual servo angle control through serial communication for testing and calibration. The system incorporates a light threshold and a deadzone to minimize jitter in low-light conditions, ensuring stable operation. A comprehensive Proteus simulation model is included to validate hardware functionality and behavior before physical deployment. This project demonstrates the integration of analog sensors, real-time motor control, and human-machine interfaces for an energy-efficient and automated solar tracking solution.',
